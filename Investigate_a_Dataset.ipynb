    "As mentioned in the [Choosing a Dataset](Choosing%20a%20Dataset.ipynb) notebook, I've chosen the [TMDb movie data](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata) dataset. The data is pretty clean already, so there won't be much to do in terms of data hygiene, but there are quite a lot of questions we can ask regarding the data, and some of them will require us to tweak the data slightly (splitting by actors, or directors, for instance).\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "I could have used Python's [cpi](https://pypi.org/project/cpi/) module to easily compute the adjustment, but I chose to use the [Inflation, consumer prices (annual %)](https://data.worldbank.org/indicator/FP.CPI.TOTL.ZG) indicator from the World Bank, combined with the formula described in this [blog post](https://www.sapling.com/5104646/calculate-inflation-adjustment).\n",

    "### Question(s) for Analysis\n",
    ">**Tip**: Clearly state one or more questions that you plan on exploring over the course of the report. You will address these questions in the **data analysis** and **conclusion** sections. Try to build your report around the analysis of at least one dependent variable and three independent variables. If you're not sure what questions to ask, then make sure you familiarize yourself with the dataset, its variables and the dataset context for ideas of what to explore.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Tip**: Once you start coding, use NumPy arrays, Pandas Series, and DataFrames where appropriate rather than Python lists and dictionaries. Also, **use good coding practices**, such as, define and use functions to avoid repetitive code. Use appropriate comments within the code cells, explanation in the mark-down cells, and meaningful variable names. "
